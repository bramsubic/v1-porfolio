             I am a Software Engineer and I have a background in Psychology and Neuroscience from the University of Toronto. During my undergrad I discovered my interest in programming while working as a research assistant. I developed a passion for finding creative technical solutions and although I still appreciate learning about people, what makes me happiest is building solutions that improve the experience of humans.
        I've recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program. As a software engineer, I enjoy working on complex problems and learning new and more efficient ways to create seamless user experiences. Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to be challenged, learn and grow alongside smart and innovative people.
